## CyberArk Resources

CyberArk provides several resources to help organizations meet compliance requirements through privileged access management solutions. 

### CyberArk Reports for Compliance
- **Privileged Accounts Inventory Report:** Provides detailed information about all privileged accounts in the system.
- **Applications Inventory Report:** Displays application IDs and associated information.
- **Privileged Accounts Compliance Status Report:** Assesses compliance of accounts with the Master Policy.
- **Entitlement Report:** Details user and group permissions within the Vault.
- **Activity Log Report:** Logs actions taken in the Vault for auditing purposes.

These reports help monitor privileged activity, ensure policy compliance, and generate evidence for audits. For the complete list of CyberArk reporting capabilities and their applications, refer to the [CyberArk Reports Documentation](https://docs.cyberark.com/pam-self-hosted/14.4/en/content/pasimp/reportsinpvwa.htm).

The Compliance Reporting document in this folder outlines specific compliance and audit use cases and how a PAM Administrator would collect that data most efficiently.
